    <string name="tab_about_us">We are couple of childhood friends and software development enthusiasts who love to work together and develop the apps which can help other people with solving their everyday tasks.\nOur motivation to create this app came from the situation where sometimes we know that we have a certain photo in our gallery, but finding it by scrolling an infinite list of thousands of small images was always annoying and inefficient.\nAfter using it in our friend group, we decided to share it publicly so that it may help others with the same problem.</string>
    <string name="tab_about_content">Using our indexing system this app will help you to search for any content in your picture and list you all of the possible matches, which you can share and edit in a few taps. You can search for objects, texts, shapes, or any information that comes to your mind. Share, edit and embed new information to curate your searches in the future. Store desired results as albums for future reference. And the best part, all of this is done locally on your device.\n\nNo information leaves your device, ever. You own your data.</string>

    <string name="onb_what_is">%1$s is an app that helps you find your images more quickly. It does so by using a text query and searching for it in image content.

    <string name="onb_permission">In order to function properly, the application will ask you the permission to read your local media. This is a core piece of our functionality. This permission allows this application to only read, not modify this media.\n\nBy granting permission to a set of images or all of them, our application can scan and index them for terms that you can later search for.
